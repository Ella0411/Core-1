    When my mother lived in Jeju Island for a year, I often visited Jeju Island.<br>This is the river where I went with my mother, and it was really pretty.<br>I had a great time imagining the future I will get married after seeing many newlyweds filming their wedding.
    </div>

    <div class="second-shape">
      The colors of the sea in Jeju Island are really colorful.<br>Sometimes, it looks like a deep blue and going to swallow everything when rainy day, but on a clear day like this picture, the waves are calm and the emerald light.<br>It was a day of healing to see many people playing.
    </div>

    <div class="third-shape">
      Jeju Island is in full bloom with beautiful flowers throughout the four seasons, so tourists are constantly visiting.<br>Among them, I like canola flowers of Jeju Island, so I often visited them in spring.<br>Jeju Island is very beautiful because you can often see canola flowers filled with large fields.
    </div>

    <div class="forth-shape">
      Jeju Island is famous for its short hiking trails called Oreum.<br>Horses are often seen on Oreum, and it is the first time I have seen a horse lying down and sleeping on this day.<br>I first learned that horses can sleep even if they lie down.
    </div>

    <div class="fifth-shape">
      This picture was taken at another Oreum, and it contains the wonderful scenery of Oreum in Jeju Island well.
    </div>

    <div class="sixth-shape">
      The last time I went to Jeju Island, I went there with my mom and sister.<br>I bought various foods at a traditional market in Jeju Island and ate them together, and it was a really delicious and happy memory.<br>It was a trip where I felt a lot of gratitude.
